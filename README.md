In Parachute Plunge you guide the falling hero to high scores by dodging hazards and collecting coins. Swipe up, down, left, or right to apply a force of the same direction to the hero. Red enemies and spikes are deadly and anything gold is good to go. One last thing… DON’T GET PUSHED OFF THE SCREEN!

This is my very first iOS game! It was built using SpriteKit and I created all of the art and music myself.
